# ESB Alpha 1.0 version: Live, Ice, Energy

## Mobs

### Sapling of Taiga Spirit
The Sapling of Taiga Spirit is a small live spruce sapling. It can be found in all kinds of taiga, where it wanders and protects the peace of the forest.

### Taiga Spirit
The Taiga Spirit is an ancient spruce ent that can be found in a small taiga ravine. If you defeat him, you can get a live spruce wood, as well as a new formidable weapon.

### Iceologer
Do you remember how Mojang wanted to add Iceologer to the game? I decided to bring this idea to an end! Meet Iceologer as I see it. Iceologer spawns in his hut in snowy bioms and drops Ominous Ice Bottle and something else with a slight chance... He also often participates in raids.

### Bonebeak
Bonebeak is a small skeleton bird that spawns in the snowy plains. It's not very dangerous, but it can become a true threat if you use the **Ominous Ice Bottle** on it!

## Bosses

### Frostybeak
Frostybeak is an existence shrouded in frosty horror. He can be summoned by giving the Bonebeak an Ominous Ice Bottle. This is a boss that can be killed in the initial stages of the game.

### Copper Golem
The Copper Golem is another mob that failed to win the Mojang vote. Now he is no longer so peaceful and a little helper that presses buttons. This is an incredible boss that can be killed in the early stages of the game and get a new kind of copper. **Keep in mind**, the worse the weather, the more powerful he is!

## Crafts
### Live Crafting Table
To get most of the new items, you need to create a new Crafting Table!
